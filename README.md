# Portfolio 
This application displays the portfolio of myself,Alejandro Castro. 
Its main features indclude:

+ navigation
+ deadnav
+ linking multiple pages
  
## Challenges
The only challenge I faced was getting the current page nav link to have a selected effect. It was quickly resolved by reading through the documentation and slides.

## Future Features
I would like to include a contact form as well as a porjects section with real projects I've deployed.
